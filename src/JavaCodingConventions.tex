\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{quotation}
“Everybody can write code that can be read by a computer,
but only good developers will write code that can be read by humans.”
\autocite{Fowler:Refactoring}
\end{quotation}

From a magazine dealing with software development tools, I found the following statement:

\begin{quotation}
“If you compare software development with the Apollo program, most programmers would be very successful bringing man to the moon, but never will get them back alive because of their common incapability to deliver software that can be maintained over a longer period of time with reasonable costs.”
\end{quotation}

Coding Conventions are primarily rules that should help making code better to maintain. Usually, this starts with making it more readable. Obviously, “readability” is a relative term, depending from one's habit. So some people are more familiar with the Kernighan-Ritchie (K\&R) style

\begin{lstlisting}
public void method (){
    if (flag) {
        /* do something */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

as it is also shown in the “Code Conventions for the Java\textsuperscript{TM} Programming Language” \autocite{SUN_CODE_CONVENTIONS}, other prefer to have the curly braces on a line of their own (sometimes referred to as GNU or BSD style\footnote{All, BSD, GNU and K\&R styles, will define more than just how to place the curly braces. In addition, all three are originally code conventions for programming in C and/or C++ that cannot applied to Java without modifications. See chapter~\ref{sec:OtherProgrammingLanguages} on this topic.}):

\begin{lstlisting}
public void method()
{
    if( flag )
    {
        /* do something */
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Both styles will work, but they look different. So as a lot of other rules from a code conventions document, too, this is a matter of taste (but refer to chapter \vref{sec:IndentationStyle}).

Nevertheless, the main purpose of those rules is to ensure that all source code looks familiar to all members of the team. As a side effect, such a look identifies source code as written by the team, as its trademark.

But there are more practical reasons to enforce these rules on the source: they make it easier …
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item … to understand the code
\item … to navigate inside the code
\item … to detect bugs
\item … to fix these bugs
\item … and to amend and enhance the code.
\end{itemize}

It can make it also easier to use automated tools on the source code.

All this is important because most of the lifetime cost of a piece of software is going into maintenance – some sources say 80 to 90\% – and nearly no source is maintained by its original author or even a single programmer for its whole lifetime.

The base of the coding conventions presented in this document are the “Code Conventions for the Java\textsuperscript{TM} Programming Language” \autocite{SUN_CODE_CONVENTIONS} we have already mentioned above, but with some changes and enhancements that seemed necessary or at least useful to me.

\section{About this Document}
The document itself consists of four major parts: first we want to talk about proper formatting of the source files, next it covers the naming of the program elements before I discuss some guidelines for writing proper comments. The final chapter before the appendices will cover general coding rules.

The code samples in this document should underline some particular aspect or demonstrate a single rule or recommendation; to stay focused on that purpose, and to keep the samples at a reasonable length, they may often hurt other rules or ignore other recommendations. For instance, in most cases, methods are lacking the required comments, or the names are not really meaningful. In addition, some rules or recommendations are first used in the samples \textit{after} being introduced.

For source code samples that obey all rules and follow all recommendations, refer to chapter~\vref{sec:Examples}.

All rules and recommendations assume that at least Java~17 is used to write the code. I used that version also for the samples.

\section{History and Implementation}
I compiled a first version of this document around the year 2000, based on the way I wrote Java code at that time. I was asked to do so for a team of developers that had been new to Java (and to programming …).

Later versions were created for other developer teams, and several software products had been created successfully following these coding conventions – proving my initial statement that coding conventions help to create maintainable software. Some of the code written by the various teams is still running, after 20 twenty years now, another code is live since 12 years now.

I wrote some libraries that supports some of the rules and recommendations, in particalur those mentioned in chapter~\ref{sec:CodingRules}, starting on page~\pageref{sec:CodingRules}. If interested, have a look to \autocite{TQUADRAT_ORG}.

\section{Other Programming Languages}\label{sec:OtherProgrammingLanguages}
Of course coding conventions like those described with this document are not only useful for Java programs, but for code in any other programming language also.\footnote{Even for descriptive languages like XML and HTML they make sense, also for documents written in TeX/LaTeX.} But each language has its unique features and specialities, meaning that coding conventions written for one programming language do not necessarily match the requirements for another.

Obviously there are some common rules that are valid for every language, but usually the differences will outweigh the similarities. So it is not a good idea to do something in language A just and only it is done that way in language B. On the other side, it should always be proved, if something that worked fine for one language would not be a great idea to be applied to code in another language. A good example for that is the JavaDoc style commenting that was adopted for various other languages, too, including so different specimen as C/C++, JavaScript and PL/SQL.\footnote{Although we have to confess that the commenting style is not part of the specification of these languages but only supported by external tools.}

But no matter what programming language is used: The \textit{Basic Rule} as defined in chapter~\ref{sec:TheBasicRule} below will be applicable to each!

A sample for code conventions for JavaScript can be found in the web at \autocite{JAVASCRIPT_CODE_CONVENTIONS}.

In \vref{sec:FormattingSQLInsideJava} we have added some rules on how to format SQL statements when added as literals into a Java program.

\section{Code Generators}
Java code that is automatically generated by another piece of software should implement this coding conventions in the same way as “hand crafted” code. Most generators are highly configurable and/or allow to use code templates that are customisable.\footnote{Perhaps you want to have a look to \autocite{TQUADRAT_ORG_FOUNDATION_JAVACOMPOSER}}

Especially if base classes will be generated it is important that proper comments are generated at least for all API elements; this means all public and protected elements, and in some cases all package-local elements, too.

Since Java~6 there is an annotation \lstinline|javax.annotation.Generated| (\lstinline|@Generated|) that should be used to mark generated code. Refer to \autocite{GENERATED_ANNOTATION} for the details.\footnote{In case still Java~5 is used as the source code version, it should be considered to create an own \lstinline|@Generated| annotation along the lines given by the existing one.}

\section{Programming for Sustaining}
And what to do with “legacy” code that has to be fixed?

Most probably that code will not follow this coding conventions (if any at all …), and it is rarely a good idea to reformat or rewrite it completely just to align it with the conventions. Instead a fix should be limited to the area that is broken.

But if possible, the fix should incorporate the standards defined by this document. Be creative how to implement the standards defined here. So if a method has to be reimplemented completely, format it as described here and add the JavaDoc comments. Or if a new field has to be added to a class, add the \lstinline|m_| prefix to its name (see chapter~\ref{sec:Fields}).

Obviously, completely new interfaces and classes should be implemented fully compliant to this conventions.

\section{Tool Support}
Several of the rules and recommendations can be implemented through the configuration of the programming enviroment that is used, especially those from chapter~\ref{sec:FormattinOfTheSourceCode} that deals with the formatting of the source code.

The chapter \ref{sec:IDEConfiguration} provides some configuration samples for Eclipse and JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA.

\section{The Basic Rule}\label{sec:TheBasicRule}
One rule should be followed before any other rule or recommendation given in this document:

\begin{center}
\begin{huge}
\fbox{\textbf{Always do it right in the first place!}}
\end{huge}
\end{center}

Experiences with lots of programming projects has shown that programmers seldom touch their code again, once it is written.\footnote{Usually, they will return to the code only when it is broken – and then the want to fix the bug, not adding missing comments …} As a result, missing comments will never be added, shady programming patterns would not be fixed – with the consequence that in case of a bug the maintainer is lost in a poorly documented chaos of badly formatted source code.

\textit{And this is exactly what we want to avoid!} 

This means there is never ever any excuse for omitting comments, using 'temporary' names or doing other 'funny' things. And we all know about the quick and dirty PoC that made it into a product without significant changes …

So again:

\begin{center}
\begin{huge}
\fbox{\textbf{Always do it right in the first place!}}
\end{huge}
\end{center}

\chapter{Formatting of the Source Code}\label{sec:FormattinOfTheSourceCode}
This chapter deals with the proper formatting of Java source code. The formatting of comments is covered in chapter~\vref{sec:WritingProperComments}.

I start the chapter with a description of the general structure of a source file, then I give some general conventions before I cover the formatting of single elements of the code.

\section{Java Source File Structure}
A file with Java source code consists of sections that should be separated by blank lines and a comment identifying each section.

Files longer than 2000 lines are cumbersome and should be avoided.\footnote{There are some well known scenarios where it is difficult to adhere with this limit. The first is with generated code, the other one is with classes having lots of attributes: the formatting style and coding rules proposed in this document require a least 5 lines for each attribute, 6 lines for each getter method and 11 lines for each setter method, always including all comments and blank lines. This is about 22 lines for each attribute. Nearly one hundred attributes seems to be a lot, but we have seen more than one real life application where database tables had more than that number of columns. We do not think that this is always a good design, but if our new Java class has to reflect the legacy data model, it has to have that number of attributes.}

Each Java source file contains a single public class or interface. When private top-level classes and interfaces are associated with a public class, they can be put into the same source file as the public class, although it is not recommended.\footnote{Usually, it should be considered to have these classes or interfaces as \textit{inner} classes/interfaces} In such a case, the public class should be the first class or interface in the file.

The sections of a Java source file have the following ordering:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
\item{Beginning comments}
\item{Package and import statements}
\item{Class and interface declarations}
\item{Closing comment}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Beginning Comments}\label{sec:BeginningComments}
All source files have begin with a c-style comment that gives the copyright notice and the license information:\footnote{This is different from \autocite{SUN_CODE_CONVENTIONS}; the Sun coding conventions recommend to put also the class name and the date into the beginning comment. I omitted the name of the class because this is obvious from the file name in case of a public class, and it would confuse the reader if the file contains more than one class. The date is considered obsolete.}
\begin{lstlisting}
/*
 * ==================================================================
 * Copyright (c) <Year> <Copyright Notice>
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * <License Notice>
 */
\end{lstlisting}
 
<Year>, <Copyright Notice> and <License Notice> has to be replaced by the appropriate texts.\footnote{And instead of the \lstinline|(c)| you should consider to use the special character \copyright; that tells you immediately whether your environment is capable to deal with UTF-8 encoded files.}

The lines with the equals signs (“===”) will end at column 80; refer to chapter~\vref{sec:LineLength}.

No other information should be added to this comment block.

\subsection{Package and Import Statements}

The first non-comment line of a Java source file is the \lstinline|package| statement\footnote{Production code will never use the default package, so there will be always a \lstinline|package| statement in every source file.}.

After that, usually several \lstinline|import| statements will follow. For example:

\begin{lstlisting}
package java.awt;

import static java.lang.String.format;
import static java.lang.System.out;

import java.awt.peer.CanvasPeer;
import java.io.InputStream;
\end{lstlisting}

Static imports has to be placed before imports for classes. Inside these blocks, the imports should be ordered alphabetically. Wildcard imports like

\begin{lstlisting}
import static java.lang.String.*;

import java.util.*;
\end{lstlisting}

are not allowed.

For the names of packages, see chapter~\vref{sec:Packages}.

Eclipse users can use the function \verb#Source|Organize Imports# from the menu, or the short-key \verb#Shift+Ctrl+O#. This will reorder the import statements, explode the wildcards and remove unused imports; it will even add currently missing imports – given that this properly configured in the \verb#preferences# at \verb#Java|Code Style|Organize Imports#.

At IntelliJ~IDEA, the function \verb#Code|Optimize Imports# from the menu does something similar; the short key would be \verb#Ctrl+Alt+O#.

\subsection{Class and Interface Declarations}\label{sec:ClassAndInterfaceDeclarations}
At least since Java~5, there are not only classes and interfaces that are declared in a Java source file. We have

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item{classes (keyword \lstinline|class|)}
\item{interfaces (keyword \lstinline|interface|)}
\item{enums (keyword \lstinline|enum|)}
\item{records (keyword \lstinline|record|)}
\item{annotations (keyword \lstinline|@interface|)}
\end{itemize}

Each of these allows different parts in their declaration; the following tables describe the various parts and the order that they should appear in the files. Each part has a header comment, and inside each part, the elements are ordered alphabetically.

\subsubsection{Class}
A skeleton for a Java \lstinline|class| may look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
public class MyClass 
{
        /*---------------*\
    ====** Inner Classes **==========================================
        \*---------------*/
        
        /*-----------*\
    ====** Constants **==============================================
        \*-----------*/
        
        /*------------*\
    ====** Attributes **=============================================
        \*------------*/
        
        /*------------------------*\
    ====** Static Initialisations **=================================
        \*------------------------*/
        
        /*--------------*\
    ====** Constructors **===========================================
        \*--------------*/
        
        /*---------*\
    ====** Methods **================================================
        \*---------*/
                
}
//  class MyClass
\end{lstlisting}
 
\begin{filecontents}{ClassParts.tbl}
  \begin{longtable}{|l|X|}
  \caption{Parts of a class declaration} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endfirsthead
  \caption{Parts of a class declaration (continued} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endhead
  Inner Classes (optional) & Given the class defines inner classes or interfaces, either \lstinline|private| or \lstinline|public|, they will come first. Internally, they will follow the same rules as their containing classes. \\ 
  \hline 
  Constants (optional) & This part takes all constants defined by this class (meaning \lstinline|public final| and \lstinline|public static final| fields). All values for the constants are known at compile time, otherwise you should place the respective field to the \textit{Static Initialisations} part. \\ 
  \hline 
  Attributes (optional) & Here go the attributes for the class; technically, this part is in fact optional for a class, but usually a class without any attributes does not make much sense. Attributes are \lstinline|private| (under some exceptional circumstances, they can be \lstinline|protected|) and usually, they are not \lstinline|static|. \\ 
  \hline 
  Static Initialisations (optional) & If a class declares \lstinline|static| fields that are not mere constants or their initialisation is more complex than just assigning a compile time constant, these fields go into this part.
  
  The fields should be initialised in a \lstinline|static {...}| block.
  
  This is also the right place for the serialVersionUID of a seria­lisable class. \\ 
  \hline 
  Constructors (optional) & All the constructors for the class go into this part. It is optional in case the class will have only an empty \lstinline|public| default constructor, but usually this will be coded, too. \\ 
  \hline 
  Methods (optional) & All methods of the class are in this part. Again, this part is technically optional, but classes without methods are barely useful.  \\ 
  \hline 
 \end{longtable} 
\end{filecontents}
\LTXtable{\linewidth}{ClassParts.tbl}

\subsubsection{Interface}
A skeleton for an \lstinline|interface| may look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
public interface MyInterface 
{
        /*---------------*\
    ====** Inner Classes **==========================================
        \*---------------*/
        
        /*-----------*\
    ====** Constants **==============================================
        \*-----------*/
        
        /*---------*\
    ====** Methods **================================================
        \*---------*/
                
}
//  interface MyInterface
\end{lstlisting}
 
\begin{filecontents}{InterfaceParts.tbl}
  \begin{longtable}{|l|X|}
  \caption{Parts of an interface declaration} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endfirsthead
  \caption{Parts of an interface declaration (continued} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endhead
  Inner Classes (optional) & Defining inner classes for an interface is discouraged, although there are some valid use cases for this. If the interface defines inner classes or interfaces, they have to be \lstinline|public| – classes have to be \lstinline|static|, too, and they will be the first part. Internally, they will follow the same rules as for top-level classes. \\ 
  \hline 
  Constants (optional) & This part takes all constants defined by this class (meaning \lstinline|public final| and \lstinline|public static final| fields). All values for the constants are known at compile time. \\ 
  \hline 
  Methods (optional) & All methods of the interface are in this part. Again, this part is technically optional, it can be omitted for so-called \textit{marker interfaces}.  \\ 
  \hline 
 \end{longtable} 
\end{filecontents}
\LTXtable{\linewidth}{InterfaceParts.tbl}

\subsubsection{enum}
An \lstinline|enum| is a special case of a Java \lstinline|class|. Usually it only contains the enumeration values, but it can have more components. A skeleton for a \lstinline|enum| may look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
public enum MyEnum 
{
        /*------------------*\
    ====** Enum Definitions **=======================================
        \*------------------*/
        
        /*-----------*\
    ====** Constants **==============================================
        \*-----------*/
        
        /*------------*\
    ====** Attributes **=============================================
        \*------------*/
        
        /*------------------------*\
    ====** Static Initialisations **=================================
        \*------------------------*/
        
        /*--------------*\
    ====** Constructors **===========================================
        \*--------------*/
        
        /*---------*\
    ====** Methods **================================================
        \*---------*/
                
}
//  enum MyEnum
\end{lstlisting}
 
\begin{filecontents}{EnumParts.tbl}
  \begin{longtable}{|l|X|}
  \caption{Parts of an enum declaration} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endfirsthead
  \caption{Parts of an enum declaration (continued} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endhead
  Enum Definitions & This part is mandatory. Each \lstinline|enum| is an instance of the enum class. \\ 
  \hline 
  Constants (optional) & This part takes all additional constants defined by this enum (meaning \lstinline|public final| and \lstinline|public static final| fields). All values for the constants are known at compile time, otherwise you should place the respective field to the \textit{Static Initialisations} part. \\ 
  \hline 
  Attributes (optional) & Here goes the attributes for the enum, if any. Each attribute has to be \lstinline|private final| and will be initialised by the constructor. \\ 
  \hline 
  Static Initialisations (optional) & If an enum declares \lstinline|static final| fields with an initialisation that is more complex than just assigning a compile time constant, these fields go into this part.
  
  The fields should be initialised in a \lstinline|static {...}| block. \\
  \hline 
  Constructors (optional) & All the constructors for the enum (rarely there is more than one) go into this part, if any. A constructor has to \lstinline|private|. \\ 
  \hline 
  Methods (optional) & All methods of the class are in this part.  \\ 
  \hline 
 \end{longtable} 
\end{filecontents}
\LTXtable{\linewidth}{EnumParts.tbl}

\subsubsection{Record}
Records had been introduced to Java with version~14. Like an enum, a record is a restricted form of a Java class. It’s ideal for "plain data carriers," classes that contain data not meant to be altered and has only the most fundamental methods such as constructors and accessors.\autocite{ORACLE_DOC_RECORD}

A skeleton for a Java \lstinline|record| may look like this, with all parts being optional:
\begin{lstlisting}
public record MyClass( ... ) 
{
        /*-----------*\
    ====** Constants **==============================================
        \*-----------*/
        
        /*------------*\
    ====** Attributes **=============================================
        \*------------*/
        
        /*------------------------*\
    ====** Static Initialisations **=================================
        \*------------------------*/
        
        /*--------------*\
    ====** Constructors **===========================================
        \*--------------*/
        
        /*---------*\
    ====** Methods **================================================
        \*---------*/
                
}
//  record MyRecord
\end{lstlisting}
 
\begin{filecontents}{RecordParts.tbl}
  \begin{longtable}{|l|X|}
  \caption{Parts of a record declaration} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endfirsthead
  \caption{Parts of a record declaration (continued} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endhead
  Constants (optional) & This part takes all constants defined by this record (meaning \lstinline|public final| and \lstinline|public static final| fields). All values for the constants are known at compile time, otherwise you should place the respective field to the \textit{Static Initialisations} part. \\ 
  \hline 
  Attributes (optional) & Here go the attributes for the class; this part is optional, because usually, all attributes are defined as arguments to the \lstinline|record| definition. \\ 
  \hline 
  Static Initialisations (optional) & If a record declares \lstinline|static| fields that are not mere constants or their initialisation is more complex than just assigning a compile time constant, these fields go into this part.
  
  The fields should be initialised in a \lstinline|static {...}| block. \\ 
  \hline 
  Constructors (optional) & If the record needs additional constructors, these go into this part. It is optional, because in most cases no additional constructor is need. \\ 
  \hline 
  Methods (optional) & All additional methods of the record are in this part. \\ 
  \hline 
 \end{longtable} 
\end{filecontents}
\LTXtable{\linewidth}{RecordParts.tbl}

\subsubsection{Annotation}
Annotations had been introduced with Java~5. 
A skeleton for an \lstinline|annotation| may look like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
public @interface MyAnnotation 
{
        /*------------*\
    ====** Attributes **=============================================
        \*------------*/
                
}
//  @interface MyAnnotation
\end{lstlisting}
 
\begin{filecontents}{AnnotationParts.tbl}
  \begin{longtable}{|l|X|}
  \caption{Parts of an annotation declaration} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endfirsthead
  \caption{Parts of an annotation declaration (continued} \\
  \hline 
  Part & Description \\ 
  \hline\endhead
  Attributes (optional) & Here go the attributes for the annotation, if any. \\ 
  \hline 
 \end{longtable} 
\end{filecontents}
\LTXtable{\linewidth}{AnnotationParts.tbl}

\subsection{Closing Comment}
A closing comment like
\begin{lstlisting}
/*
 *  End of File
 */
\end{lstlisting}
at the end of the source file is helpful to detect whether a source file was corrupted: if missing, there is a good chance that the file is incomplete.

I confess that this kind of error has got very unlikely with modern hard-drives, but it can still happen when sending around sources over the net.

\section{Indentation}
Indentation, together with empty lines, is the most important tool to structure any source code.

\subsection{Indentation Style}\label{sec:IndentationStyle}
I prefer the so-called GNU or BSD style and recommend it to you as well, because it makes it easier to detect the begin and the end of a code block. It demands to have the opening and closing curly braces on a line of their own, like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
public class MyClass
{
    public void method()
    {
        if( flag )
        {
            /* do something */
        }
        
        for( final var i = 0; i < max; ++i )
        {
            /* do something else */
        } 
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Indentation Size}
Four (4) spaces should be used as the unit of indentation. Tabs are not allowed.\footnote{This is different from \autocite{SUN_CODE_CONVENTIONS}; the Sun Coding Convention do not explicitly specify whether to use blanks or tabs.} Usually this can be configured in your IDE; in Eclipse this is part of the \textit{Formatter} definition (\verb#Window|Preferences|Java|Code Style|Formatter#).

\subsection{Line Length}\label{sec:LineLength}
Some sources (including the “Code Conventions for the Java\textsuperscript{TM} Programming Language” \autocite{SUN_CODE_CONVENTIONS}) recommend to avoid lines longer than 80 characters, because they were not handled well by many terminals and tools.

This had been true at the time those documents were written, but today's  graphical screens are much wider (sometimes even 200 characters can be put into one line), and modern tools do not even care about line length, so we do not want to recommend a fixed line length for source code.

\textbf{Note:} Sample code for use in documentation should have a limited line length – generally not more than 70 characters.

Different to that, comment lines are limited to 80 characters – or more precise, they have to end at column 80. All lines with “ASCII graphics” are extented to that column. This is pertaining to the beginning comments (chapter \vref{sec:BeginningComments}), the structuring comments (chapter \vref{sec:StructuringComments}) and most single-line comments (chapter \ref{sec:SingleLineComments}).

\subsubsection{Wrapping Lines}\label{sec:WrappingLines}
When an expression does not fit on a single line, break it according to these general principles:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item{Break after a comma.}
\item{Break before an operator.}
\item{Prefer higher-level breaks to lower-level breaks.}
\item{Align the new line with the beginning of the expression at the same level on the previous line.}
\item{If the above rules lead to confusing code or to code that's squished up against the right margin, just indent 8 (eight) spaces instead.}
\end{itemize}

Here are some examples of breaking method calls:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
// USUAL
someMethod( longExpression1, longExpression2, longExpression3,
    longExpression4, longExpression5 );
        
// SINGLE LINE FOR EACH ARGUMENT
someMethod
( 
    longExpression1,
    longExpression2,
    longExpression3,
    longExpression4, // some comment
    longExpression5
);

// LONG EXPRESSIONS
var = someMethod1( longExpression1,
        someMethod2( longExpression2,
                longExpression3 ) );
\end{lstlisting}

Using a single line for each argument makes especially sense in cases where one or more expressions are really long, or if a comment should be added to the argument.

Next there are two examples of breaking an arithmetic expression. The first is preferred, since the break occurs outside the parenthesized expression, which is at a higher level.
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4 - longName5)
           + 4 * longname6; // PREFER
longName1 = longName2 * (longName3 + longName4
                       - longName5) + 4 * longname6; // AVOID!!!!!
\end{lstlisting}

Then we have three examples of indenting method declarations. The first is the conventional case. The second would shift the second and third lines to the far right if it uses conventional indentation, so instead it indents only 8 spaces. The final one uses a single line for each argument.

A throws clause will be either appended on the same line as the closing parentheses, or it can be on its own line with an indentation of four blanks.
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
// CONVENTIONAL INDENTATION
public void someMethod( int anArg, Object anotherArg,
            String yetAnotherArg, Object andStillAnother )
{
    // Code
}

public void otherMethod( int anArg, Object anotherArg,
            String yetAnotherArg, Object andStillAnother )
    throws IllegalArgumentException, IOException
{
    // Code
}

// INDENT 8 SPACES TO AVOID VERY DEEP INDENTS
private static synchronized void horkingLongMethodName( int anArg,
        Object anotherArg, String yetAnotherArg,
        Object andStillAnother )
{
    // Code
}

private static synchronized void horkingLongMethodThrows( int anArg,
        Object anotherArg, String yetAnotherArg,
        Object andStillAnother ) throws IllegalArgumentException
{
    // Code
}

// SINGLE LINE FOR EACH ARGUMENT
private static synchronized anotherHorkingLongMethodLine
(
    int anArg,
    Object anotherArg,
    String yetAnotherArg,
    Object andStillAnother
)
{
    // Code
}

private static synchronized anotherHorkingLongMethodLineThrows
(
    int anArg,
    Object anotherArg,
    String yetAnotherArg,
    Object andStillAnother
) throws IllegalArgumentException, IOException
{
    // Code
}
\end{lstlisting}

Here are three acceptable ways to format ternary expressions\footnote{Read more about the ternary operator \lstinline|?| in chapter \vref{sec:TheTernaryOperator}.}:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta : gamma;
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta
                                 : gamma;
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression)
        ? beta
        : gamma;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Declarations}
This chapter deals with the formatting of declarations. See also chapter \vref{sec:WrappingLines} for informations on how to wrap long declarations.

\subsection{Multiple Declarations per Line}
It is strongly encouraged to have only one declaration per line, as it is also comforting to add comments to the declaration. In other words, 
\begin{lstlisting}
int level; // indentation level
int size;  // size of table
\end{lstlisting}

is preferred over

\begin{lstlisting}
int level, size; // AVOID!!!
\end{lstlisting}

Do not put different types on the same line, despite the compiler does not complain about it. Example:
\begin{lstlisting}
int foo, fooarray []; // WRONG!!!!
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Array Declarations}
The brackets for an array declaration always have to be put to the type, not to the name. So it should read
\begin{lstlisting}
int [] foo;
String [] bar;
java.awt.Button [] buttons;
\end{lstlisting}
and not
\begin{lstlisting}
int foo []; // AVOID!!!
String bar []; // AVOID!!!
java.awt.Button buttons []; // AVOID!!!
\end{lstlisting}
This is the same way as an array would be declared as the return value for a method:
\begin{lstlisting}
public final static String [] getTexts()
{
    return m_Texts;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Placement of Declarations}
You should put declarations where there are needed; usually this means that it should be waited with the declaration of variables until their first use.\footnote{In this aspect, my point of view is completely contradicting to that of the authors of \autocite{SUN_CODE_CONVENTIONS}.}

This is true even for variables inside a loop:
\begin{lstlisting}
for( var i = 0; i < limit; ++i )
{
    final var a = getValue( i );
    // more code
}
\end{lstlisting}

Only the repeated initialisation of a variable inside a loop should be avoided, when possible:
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
// AVOID!
for( var i = 0; i < limit; ++i )
{
    final var a = new VeryComplexType();
    // more code
}
\end{lstlisting}
In this case, line~4 should be moved before the loop header (line~2).

Absolutely avoid local declarations that hide declarations at higher levels. For example, do not declare a variable with the same name as a field:
\begin{lstlisting}
public class MyClass
{
    int count;

    public void method()
    {
        if( condition )
        {
            int count = 0; // AVOID!
            // more code
        }
        // more code
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
There are a settings for both Eclipse preferences and IntelliJ~IDEA that triggers a warning or even an error in such cases. In addition, the rules for the naming of fields (refer to chapter \vref{sec:Fields}) would make such a situation unlikely.

\section{Implementation Comment Formats}

\subsection{Structuring Comments}\label{sec:StructuringComments}
These are the easiest comments: they are used to separate the sections or parts of a class (as defined in chapter \vref{sec:ClassAndInterfaceDeclarations}) from each other. They have the form
\begin{lstlisting}
    /*------------------*\
====** Enum Declaration **===========================================
    \*------------------*/
    /*---------------*\
====** Inner Classes **==============================================
    \*---------------*/
    /*-----------*\
====** Constants **==================================================
    \*-----------*/
    /*------------*\
====** Attributes **=================================================
    \*------------*/
    /*------------------------*\
====** Static Initialisations **=====================================
    \*------------------------*/
    /*--------------*\
====** Constructors **===============================================
    \*--------------*/
    /*---------*\
====** Methods **====================================================
    \*---------*/
\end{lstlisting}

with the lines ending at column 80 (the samples here are too short).

If a class or interface does not have a particular section or part, the assigned structuring comment must be omitted.

I recommend to create “Building Blocks” with these comments. Eclipse provides the Snippet facility for this purpose\footnote{Storing the comments as code templates is not recommended as a template would be reformatted on insert.}. Refer to chapter \vref{sec:SnippetStructuringComments} for the snippet code for the structuring comments.
